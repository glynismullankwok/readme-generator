# readme generator

This is a project to develop a software app to assist developers in writing the best 
Readme for their repositories.

## user story

As a developer I need to accurately describe my project and provide the necessary 
technical information that was used in developing this software.  The clearer my 
read me is, the easier it is for employers and other developers to see the work and 
design put into this project.
